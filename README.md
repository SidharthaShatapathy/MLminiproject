# MLminiproject
Built ML models (Linear, RF, GBM) to predict CaSi consumption in steelmaking using real plant data. Included plant data preprocessing, SHAP-based feature selection, and visual analysis to identify poor additive practices and support cost-saving recommendations.

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict calcium silicide (CaSi) consumption in secondary steelmaking based on chemical composition data and other data related to turn around time, arcing time, etc. A total of 23 features were used for consideration. Developed as a side-project during my internship at Tata Steel, the project involved cleaning and merging noisy real-world plant data, training regression models (Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and leveraging SHAP values to interpret feature importance. The insights were used to identify suboptimal practices in additive usage, supporting cost-saving recommendations for plant leadership. It was also used on data from other plants of TATA Steel with better practices to predict calcium yield (a derived feature).

Due to confidentiality reasons, I have not included the datasets
